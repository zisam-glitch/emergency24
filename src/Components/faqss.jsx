                We only really see dental emergencies, and we always send
                patients back to their own registered dentist. Most dentists
                would be upset if we were to register the patients we have seen
                out of hours. <br />
                <br /> If you don’t have a dentist and want to be seen the
                dentist will still be able to treat any further issues however
                we don’t operate as normal dental practices and request you are
                seen every 6 months. Any time you want to book an appointment to
                see one of the dentists you can do so any time. Book online or
                Call us. The responsibility lies with you as when you want to be
                seen.

                Try over the counter painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen.
                Only take the medications if you are normally ok taking them.
                Occasionally it will reduce the pain slightly until you can get
                to the dentist. This is only a temporary measure but sometimes
                it helps if you have no other alternative. <br />
                <br /> Hot salt water mouth washes are very useful if you have a
                swelling or some sort of infection. Salt water is a natural anti
                septic and can reduce pain.

                Many people suffer with dental pain at night time. A lot of the
                time the pain makes it unbearable to sleep. A lot of pain at
                night time is due to the position of you lying down, blood
                rushing to the head and the pain or swelling inside the tooth
                increase.
                <br /> <br />
                Before getting to this level of pain we always advise a visit to
                the dentist so to avoid such dilemmas. The dentist will take x
                rays and check which tooth is causing the pain. So many times
                the pain spreads top and bottom unable to locate the pain. Thus
                the x ray is one of the best tests to elicit where the pain is
                coming from.

                <br />
                Out of hours NHS do provide emergency appointments but have very
                strict criteria such as persistent bleeding and unable to
                breathe or swallow due to swelling. <br /> <br />
                If this is the case your NHS dentist should have an alternate
                local number for you to call in the case of emergency. <br />
                <br />
                Emergency247Dentist provides private treatment and promises to
                see you on the same day. You can contact one of the reception
                staff members or book online and get an appointment immediately.

                We are an emergency dental service. So most of the time we see
                nervous patients. No one likes coming to the dentist. Once you
                speak to us on the phone we will reassure you and guarantee you
                won’t have to be nervous about anything. We work very relaxed
                and all of our patients (well most) really enjoy their time with
                us.
